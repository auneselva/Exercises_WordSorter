# Exercise - Word Sorter

This project was made for exercise. It's a simple Word Sorter that counts frequency of all the words in a given text and sorts them accordingly.
Created in **Visual Studio 2022** using CMake template project.

## Getting Started

If you happen to setup this project on your computer, I encourage you to start by looking into `CMakeWordExerciseMain.cpp` - it stores the `main()` function, where the sorting functions from `WordSorter` class are executed on example texts which are defined in `WordSorterTest`. 
Also `Timer` object measures time of executing the counting and sorting operations on each example text.
